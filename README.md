## Python Virtual Environment

`python3 -m venv .venv` - to create a virtual environment in the current folder.

The name of the virtual environment shows next to the command prompt - with the above command will default to the parent folder name - i.e. `(.venv)`

In not automatically activated (or to activate later) then `source .venv/bin/activate`.

To leave a Python virtual environment, you can use: `source deactivate`.

## Installing modules

`pip install -q -U ...` - to install the libraries.

- `-q` is quiet mode (or `-v)
- `-U` is upgrade
